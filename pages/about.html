					<h2>My Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Hi, I'm Essien Joy — a self-taught front-end developer passionate
						about creating clean, user-focused digital experiences. My journey
						into tech started with curiosity, and it has since grown into a deep
						interest in functional JavaScript, modern UI design, and web
						performance.

				<section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-goals">
					<h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
					<p>
						My main goal is to master JavaScript, React, and front-end
						development best practices. I want to be confident writing clean,
						maintainable code while building real-world projects that make a
						difference.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-confidence">
					<h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
					<p>
						Sometimes I struggle with understanding advanced functional
						programming concepts and optimizing state management in complex
						apps. But I’m learning to take it step by step and celebrate
						progress along the way.
					</p>

				<section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-future-note">
					<h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
					<p>
						Keep going — even when things feel challenging. Remember how far
						you’ve come and that consistency always wins. The best version of
						you is already in progress.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
					<h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
					<p>
						I’ve learned that learning to code isn’t just about syntax — it’s
						about problem-solving, patience, and creativity. I’m excited to see
						where this journey takes me.
